            <p>Hello I will write how to reborn in this article</p>
            <p>This is articles second paragraph</p>
            <p>I don't know if you can believe that but this is the third paragraph.</p>
            <p class="longtext">This is a really big paragrah to test a psudo-class. I wonder why they call it that way. I don't there are classes in CSS. Do they talk about classes inside of tags which inside of HTML. I think we should change their name because I don't like pseudo word. What we should call them you may ask. Sorry but I didn't think anything I thought you would think something, I would get it by a button and inputs but I didn't learn them yet. How can I know them if I didn't learn them? I `coded` in HTML before but just the juicy stuff like making a website using &lt;table&gt;'s. I didn't know back then but it was used because of foot, head etc. didn't work properly.</p>
            <p id="password">This paragraph has a id of a password.</p>
